“May I?” – Petersen Family Rules

A contract rummy style game where you “May I?” to grab discards out of turn and race to lay down specific combinations.

⸻

1. Basics

Players: 3 to 8
Decks:
• 3 to 5 players: 2 standard decks + 4 Jokers
• 6 to 8 players: 3 decks + 6 Jokers

Hands: 6 hands total.
Cards dealt: 11 cards to each player every hand.

Goal:
After all 6 hands, the player with the lowest total score wins.

⸻

2. Card ranks, wilds, and points

Rank order: A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

Wild cards:
• All 2s
• All Jokers

Card values for scoring:
• 2 to 10: face value
• J, Q, K: 10 points
• Ace: 15 points
• Joker: 50 points

Jokers are powerful but brutal if they are stuck in your hand at the end of a hand.

⸻

3. Contracts by hand

Definitions:
• Set (group): 3 or more cards of the same rank, any suits
• Run (sequence): 4 or more cards of the same suit in consecutive order

6 hand sequence: 1. Hand 1: 2 sets 2. Hand 2: 1 set + 1 run 3. Hand 3: 2 runs 4. Hand 4: 3 sets 5. Hand 5: 2 sets + 1 run 6. Hand 6: 1 set + 2 runs (last hand, "no discard" round)

You must have the entire contract in your hand before you can lay down.

⸻

4. Setup and deal
   1. Shuffle all decks together.
   2. Each player draws a card; high card deals the first hand. Dealer then rotates left each hand.
   3. Dealer gives 11 cards to each player.
   4. Place the remaining stack face down as the stock pile.
   5. Turn the top stock card face up to start the discard pile.

⸻

5. Turn structure

Play goes clockwise.

On your turn: 1. Draw exactly one card:
• Either the top card of the stock pile
• Or the top card of the discard pile (if it has not been taken via “May I?”) 2. Optionally lay down:
• If you have not laid down yet this hand
• And you can fully satisfy the contract for that hand in one go 3. No lay off on the same turn you lay down:
• On the turn you first lay down your contract, you lay down only the contract.
• You can NOT immediately add extra cards to your own or others’ melds that same turn. 4. Lay off (future turns only):
• Starting on your next turn after laying down, you may:
• Draw
• Then add cards to any existing melds on the table (yours or others)
• Then discard 5. Discard one card to end your turn:
• One card face up on the discard pile
• Exception 1: You may go out without a discard in any round if you play all your cards to melds.
• Exception 2: In Round 6, you CANNOT discard at all (see “Hand 6”).

⸻

6. Wild card rules

Wilds are 2s and Jokers.
• Wilds can stand in for any rank and suit in a set or a run.
• In any meld you put down, wilds cannot outnumber natural cards:
• OK: 9♣ 9♦ Joker (2 natural, 1 wild)
• Not OK: 9♣ Joker Joker (1 natural, 2 wild)

Joker swapping (family rule):
• Jokers can be swapped out of runs only, never out of sets.
• To swap a Joker in a run:
• The Joker must be clearly acting as a specific missing card in a valid run
• You play the real card into that run and take the Joker into your hand

Important restriction:
You may only swap Jokers if you have not laid down yet this hand.
Once you have laid down your contract, you lose the right to perform Joker swaps for the rest of that hand.

7. The "May I?" rule

When May I? is available:
• A May I? can only be called when a discard is "exposed" — sitting unclaimed on the discard pile.
• If the current player draws from the discard pile, the card is gone and no May I? is possible.
• If the current player draws from the stock pile, the top discard remains exposed and available for May I?.

Calling May I?:
• Any player (except the current player) may call "May I?" to claim the exposed discard.
• The caller takes the discard AND draws 1 penalty card from the stock.
• Turn order does not change; the caller simply has more cards now.

Priority and vetoing:
• When someone calls May I?, any player closer in turn order may veto by claiming the card instead.
• The current player has first right of refusal — but only if they have not yet drawn from the stock.
• If the current player vetoes: they take the discard as their draw (no penalty). This counts as their draw action; they cannot also draw from stock.
• If a non-current player vetoes: they effectively May I? themselves — taking the discard plus 1 penalty card from stock.
• Once the current player draws from stock, they forfeit the right to veto any May I? calls on that discard.

Priority tiebreaker:
• If multiple players call May I? simultaneously, priority goes to whoever is closest in turn order after the current player.

No limit on May I? usage per hand.

8. Laying down (initial meld)

To lay down: 1. It must be your turn, after you draw. 2. You must have enough cards to exactly fulfill the contract for that hand. 3. Lay those cards face up in front of you, clearly separated into sets and runs. 4. On this turn, you only lay down the contract. No laying off extras yet. 5. Discard one card to end your turn (except when going out on Hand 6).

After laying down:
• You are considered “down” for this hand.
• On later turns, you can lay off extras and try to empty your hand.

⸻

9. Laying off (adding to melds)

Starting from your next turn after laying down:

On your turn, after drawing, you may:
• Add cards to any valid melds on the table:
• Extend runs (e.g. add 5♠ or 10♠ to a 6♠ 7♠ 8♠ 9♠ run)
• Extend sets (e.g. add another 8 of a different suit to a set of 8s)
• Use wilds, as long as the meld remains valid and wilds do not outnumber natural cards

Then discard one card (unless you are going out in Hand 6 with no discard).

⸻

10. Going out and the last hand

A hand ends when someone goes out.

Hands 1 to 5

To go out:
• On your turn you draw
• Play cards (lay off, use wilds, etc.) until you have one card left
• Discard your last card
• Everyone else then scores the remaining cards in their hand

Hand 6 (last hand, “no discard”)

On Hand 6:
• You CANNOT discard. Every turn must end without a discard.
• To go out, you must finish with no cards in your hand by playing them all to melds.
• If you cannot play a card and cannot go out, your turn simply ends after drawing (and potentially laying down or laying off). Your hand will grow if you are stuck.

If the stock pile runs out:
• Turn the discard pile over (keep the top discard face up) to form a new stock.
• If it somehow runs out again, you can either:
• Agree that the hand ends immediately and all players score what they hold, or
• House-rule a reshuffle.
Pick one consistent approach before you start playing.

⸻

11. Scoring and winning

After each hand: 1. The player who went out scores 0 points. 2. All other players add up the point values of the cards left in their hand:
• 2 to 10: face value
• J, Q, K: 10
• A: 15
• Joker: 50

Write down running totals.

After all 6 hands, the player with the lowest total score is the winner.
