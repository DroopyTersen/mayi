# Lay-off position ignored for 2nd+ card to same run

## Type

Bug

## Priority

high

## Description

When laying off multiple cards onto the same run in a single lay-off step, the position selection (start/end) only works correctly for the first card. The second and subsequent cards always go to the end of the run, even if "Start" is selected.

### Replication Steps

1. Have a run on the table: 7, 8, 9, 10 of hearts
2. Have cards in hand that could extend the low end: 5 and 6 of hearts
3. Enter lay-off mode
4. Click the 6, then click the run and select "Start"
   - Run becomes: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (correct)
5. Click the 5, then click the run and select "Start"
   - Expected: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
   - Actual: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 5 (5 goes to end despite selecting "Start")

### Expected Behavior

When selecting "Start" for subsequent cards, they should be prepended to the run (accounting for any previously staged cards at the start).

### Actual Behavior

Only the first card respects the position selection. Additional cards staged to the same run always append to the end.

### Likely Cause

The `LayOffView.tsx` component stages lay-offs with position, but when checking `needsPositionChoice()` or determining valid positions for subsequent cards, it's likely checking against the original meld state rather than the meld + previously staged cards.
