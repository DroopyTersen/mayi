# Column: Done

**Actor:** None
**Agent:** None
**Commit:** None

---

## Summary

Terminal state. Work is complete, approved, and committed. The card remains as permanent documentation of the work performed.

The Ralph Loop ignores cards in this column.

---

## Definition of Done

N/A - This is the terminal state.

---

## What Happens

Card arrives from Human Review after approval.

- Work item is complete
- Card context contains the full history
- Commits (spec and implementation) are in repository history
- Card remains for future reference
- Dependent cards are notified (if any)

### Notify Dependent Cards

When a card reaches Done, check if any other cards depend on it:

**For GitHub backend:**
```bash
# Search for issues that have this card as a predecessor
# Look for "Blocked by: #THIS_NUMBER" in issue bodies
gh search issues "Blocked by: #{NUMBER}" --repo {OWNER}/{REPO} --json number,title
```

**For JSON backend:**
```
Search all card context files for:
- "Blocked by:" containing this card's ID
```

**For each dependent found:**
Add a comment notifying them the predecessor is complete:

```
/af context {dependent-id} append "
## Conversation Log

**[Agent - {date}]:** Predecessor #{this-id} ({title}) has been completed and merged to main.
- This card is now unblocked from that dependency
- Check remaining dependencies with \`/af depends {dependent-id}\`
"
```

This helps dependent cards know when they can proceed or rebase onto main.

## Archival

Done cards can be:
- **Left in place** for reference (recommended initially)
- **Archived** periodically (backend-specific location)
- **Deleted** after a retention period

The card serves as permanent documentation of:
- What was built and why
- Decisions made along the way
- Who reviewed and approved
- Commit references for traceability
- Branch name for future reference

---

## Entry Criteria

- Human Review approved

---

## Exit Criteria

None (terminal state)

---

## Important Notes

- **Cards are documentation** - they capture the full journey
- **Commits are linked** - spec and implementation commits are recorded
- **History tells the story** - the history table shows progression
- **Keep for reference** - valuable for understanding past decisions
- **Dependents are notified** - when this card completes, cards that depend on it are informed
