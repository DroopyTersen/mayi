# May I? Game Strategy Guide

This document outlines strategic principles for playing May I? effectively.

## Core Principle: Going Down is Priority #1

Getting caught with a full hand when someone goes out is catastrophic. A single round where you hold 11 cards can result in 100+ points. In a game where winning scores are typically 50-80 total across 6 rounds, one bad round can end your chances.

**Every decision should be evaluated against: "Does this help me go down?"**

---

## Hand Planning

At the start of each round, evaluate your hand and form a plan:

1. **Identify your primary melds** - Which sets or runs are you building toward?
2. **Identify backup options** - Keep alternative paths open (e.g., hold a third pair even if you already have two pairs committed)
3. **Identify discard candidates** - Which cards are singletons with no path to a meld?

**When to switch plans:** Switch from Plan A to Plan B when you draw something that makes Plan B stronger, not simply because Plan A isn't working yet.

## Discard Strategy

When choosing what to discard, follow this priority:

1. **Never discard what an opponent is collecting** - If you saw someone pick up a 7, do not discard 7s
2. **Never discard what plays on existing melds** - Once melds are on the table, those ranks/suits become dangerous to discard
3. **Among safe discards, choose the highest point value** - Shed point liability from your hand
4. **Hold cards that might play onto future melds** - Even if a card doesn't help your contract, it may help you lay off after going down

**Exception:** In endgame, if you believe someone will go out before your next turn, discard your highest point cards even if they play on melds. Minimize your score.

## May I? Decision Framework

May I? is not simply "do I want this card?" - it requires board state analysis.

**Factors to evaluate:**

- **How many players are down?** One person down with 3 cards is safer than everyone down.
- **How many cards does the leading player have?** If someone has 1-2 cards and multiple melds are on the table, they could go out any turn.
- **Have table melds changed since their last turn?** If a player held a card through their turn and couldn't play it, and no new melds have appeared, they still can't play it.
- **Does this card complete my contract?** May I is most justified when it directly enables you to go down.
- **What is my position?** If the player before you might go out, May I adds 2 cards to your hand and you may never get to use them.

**General guidance:**

- May I for a card that lets you go down: Usually worth it
- May I when everyone is down and someone has 1-2 cards: Very risky
- May I in early rounds (especially set-heavy rounds): Lower risk, penalty card has decent odds of being useful
- May I when you're far from going down: Rarely worth it

## Wild Card Strategy

Wilds (2s and Jokers) are powerful but dangerous if you get caught holding them.

**Usage principles:**

- **Use a wild to go down if necessary** - Going down is priority #1
- **If you can go down without using a wild, do so** - Save wilds for laying off, where they provide flexibility
- **Exception: If someone is about to go out, include wilds in your laydown** - Get them out of your hand to avoid the point penalty

**Joker swapping:**

- Rare opportunity, but generally worth taking if available
- Must be done before you lay down your contract
- Jokers are valuable for laying off on any meld
- Risk: Getting caught with a 50-point Joker if someone goes out

## Tracking Opponents

**What to watch:**

- **Discard pile pickups** - If someone takes a 7 from discard, they are collecting 7s. Do not discard 7s. Hold your 7s to lay off on their meld later.
- **Discard patterns** - If someone consistently discards hearts, they are likely not building heart runs
- **Card count** - Track how many cards each player has. Fewer cards = closer to going out.
- **Table melds** - Once someone lays down, you know exactly what they have. Track what can extend their melds.

**Using this information:**

- Avoid feeding opponents cards they need
- Hold cards that play onto their melds for your own layoffs
- Assess risk of someone going out based on their card count and available layoff targets

## Round Phases

Each round progresses through distinct phases with different strategic considerations:

1. **Opening** - Assess your hand, form primary and backup plans, identify discard candidates
2. **Building** - Draw and discard, watch opponents, refine your plan based on what you draw and observe
3. **First Laydown** - Once someone goes down, urgency increases significantly for everyone else
4. **Racing** - Multiple players are down, focus shifts to emptying your hand as fast as possible
5. **Endgame** - A player has 1-2 cards. May I becomes very risky. Consider point-dumping if you believe you'll get caught.

## Round-Specific Notes

**Rounds 1 and 4 (Set-heavy: 2 sets, 3 sets)**
- Sets require only rank matching, making them more flexible
- Easier to pivot between different set options
- Penalty cards from May I have higher odds of being useful

**Rounds 2 and 5 (Mixed: set + run, 2 sets + run)**
- Flexibility in which part of the contract to lock in first
- Runs are more constraining than sets

**Rounds 3 (2 runs)**
- Runs require specific suit AND sequence
- Harder to pivot, cards are less interchangeable
- May I penalty cards less likely to be useful

**Round 6 (1 set + 2 runs) - Special Rules**
- No one is "down" until someone wins
- You must use ALL cards in your hand to lay down
- No laying off exists (no melds on table until game ends)
- May I is extra risky: each May I adds 2 cards that must ALL become melds
- "Give up" strategy: Only viable if you are ahead by enough points that getting caught still wins the game. Calculate whether your hand value keeps you ahead of second place.

## Card Tracking

Be aware of how many decks are in play:
- 3-5 players: 2 decks (2 copies of each card, 4 Jokers)
- 6-8 players: 3 decks (3 copies of each card, 6 Jokers)

**Dead cards:** If you've seen multiple copies of a card discarded, remaining copies are less useful for runs (fewer sequence options) but still valid for sets.

## Summary: Key Principles

1. **Going down is non-negotiable priority #1** - Everything else is secondary
2. **Always have a plan with backups** - Know which melds you're building
3. **Watch opponents** - Track what they collect, don't feed them
4. **Evaluate May I against board state** - Not just "do I want this card"
5. **Manage wilds carefully** - Powerful for flexibility, dangerous if caught
6. **Shed point liability** - Discard high cards you won't use
7. **Adapt to round phase** - Early game is building; late game is racing and risk management
