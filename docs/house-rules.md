"May I?" – Petersen Family Rules

A contract rummy style game where you "May I?" to grab discards out of turn and race to lay down specific combinations.

⸻

1. Basics

Players: 3 to 8
Decks:
• 3 to 5 players: 2 standard decks + 4 Jokers
• 6 to 8 players: 3 decks + 6 Jokers

Hands: 6 hands total.
Cards dealt: 11 cards to each player every hand.

Goal:
After all 6 hands, the player with the lowest total score wins.

⸻

2. Card ranks, wilds, and points

Rank order: A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

Wild cards:
• All 2s
• All Jokers

Card values for scoring:
• 3 to 10: face value
• 2 (wild): 20 points
• J, Q, K: 10 points
• Ace: 15 points
• Joker: 50 points

Jokers are powerful but brutal if they are stuck in your hand at the end of a hand.

⸻

3. Contracts by hand

Definitions:
• Set (group): 3 or more cards of the same rank, any suits. Duplicate suits are allowed since this is a multi-deck game (e.g., 7♠ 7♠ 7♦ is a valid set).
• Run (sequence): 4 or more cards of the same suit in consecutive order

6 hand sequence:
1. Hand 1: 2 sets
2. Hand 2: 1 set + 1 run
3. Hand 3: 2 runs
4. Hand 4: 3 sets
5. Hand 5: 2 sets + 1 run
6. Hand 6: 1 set + 2 runs (special rules — see "Hand 6" section)

You must have the entire contract in your hand before you can lay down.

⸻

4. Setup and deal

1. Shuffle all decks together.
2. Each player draws a card; high card deals the first hand. Dealer then rotates left each hand.
3. Dealer gives 11 cards to each player.
4. Place the remaining stack face down as the stock pile.
5. Turn the top stock card face up to start the discard pile.

⸻

5. Turn structure (Hands 1–5)

Play goes clockwise.

**IMPORTANT: You must always draw first.** Before you can lay down, lay off, or discard, you must draw a card. No other action is valid until you have drawn.

On your turn:

1. **Draw exactly one card** (REQUIRED as first action):
   • Either the top card of the stock pile
   • Or the top card of the discard pile (if it has not been taken via "May I?")
   • Once you have laid down ("down"), you may only draw from the stock pile — never from the discard pile.

2. **Optionally lay down** (only after drawing):
   • If you have not laid down yet this hand
   • And you can fully satisfy the contract for that hand in one go

3. **No lay off on the same turn you lay down:**
   • On the turn you first lay down your contract, you lay down only the contract.
   • You may NOT immediately add extra cards to your own or others' melds that same turn.

4. **Lay off** (future turns only, after drawing):
   • Starting on your next turn after laying down, you may:
   • Draw first (always required)
   • Then add cards to any existing melds on the table (yours or others)
   • Then discard

5. **Discard one card to end your turn:**
   • One card face up on the discard pile
   • Exception: You may go out without a discard if you play all your cards to melds.

⸻

6. Wild card rules

Wilds are 2s and Jokers.
• Wilds can stand in for any rank and suit in a set or a run.
• **When laying down your contract**, wilds cannot outnumber natural cards:
  • OK: 9♣ 9♦ Joker (2 natural, 1 wild)
  • Not OK: 9♣ Joker Joker (1 natural, 2 wild)
• **When laying off to existing melds**, the wild ratio rule does NOT apply:
  • You can add wilds to melds freely, even if wilds end up outnumbering naturals
  • Example: A set of 7♠ 7♦ 2♥ on the table can have another 2♣ added (now 2 naturals, 2 wilds)
  • Example: That same meld can have yet another 2♦ added (now 2 naturals, 3 wilds) — still valid!

Joker swapping (family rule):
• Jokers can be swapped out of runs only, never out of sets.
• To swap a Joker in a run:
  • The Joker must be clearly acting as a specific missing card in a valid run
  • You play the real card into that run and take the Joker into your hand

Important restriction:
You may only swap Jokers if you have not laid down yet this hand.
Once you have laid down your contract, you lose the right to perform Joker swaps for the rest of that hand.

**Note:** Joker swapping is not possible in Hand 6 because there are no melds on the table until someone wins.

7. The "May I?" rule

**When May I? is available:**
• A May I? can only be called when a discard is "exposed" — sitting unclaimed on the discard pile.
• If the current player draws from the discard pile, the card is gone and no May I? is possible.
• If the current player draws from the stock pile, the top discard remains exposed and available for May I?.

**Calling May I?:**
• Any player (except the current player) may call "May I?" to claim the exposed discard.
• **EXCEPTION: Down players cannot call May I.** Once you have laid down, you may only draw from the stock pile, never from the discard pile. This means you are completely ineligible for May I? claims.
• The caller takes the discard AND draws 1 penalty card from the stock.
• Turn order does not change; the caller simply has more cards now.

**Priority and claiming:**

Think of turn order as a line. When a discard is exposed, everyone is "in line" for it. If someone behind you announces they want it, you don't need to do anything special — you simply have first dibs because you're ahead of them.

How priority works:
• The current player is first in line
• Then the next player in turn order, then the next, and so on
• **Down players are not in line at all.** They cannot draw from the discard pile, so they are never asked about May I? and cannot claim discards.

When someone calls May I?:
• Anyone ahead of them in line can claim the card instead
• If you're ahead and want it, you take it — that's your right
• If no one ahead of them claims it, the caller gets it

What "claiming" costs:
• Current player: takes the discard as their normal draw (no penalty)
• Anyone else: takes the discard + 1 penalty card from stock (same as a May I?)

The current player loses their spot in line once they draw from stock. After that, they can't claim the exposed discard even if someone behind them calls May I?.

**Resolving competing claims:**

If multiple players call May I? at the same time, the one closest to the front of the line (earliest in turn order after the current player) gets priority.

No limit on May I? usage per hand.

**Hand 6 note:** In Hand 6, since no one is ever "down" until they win, all players remain in line throughout the entire hand. However, May I? is extra risky in Hand 6 because each May I? adds 2 cards (discard + penalty) that must ALL be incorporated into your melds when you lay down.

8. Laying down (initial meld) — Hands 1–5

To lay down:
1. It must be your turn, after you draw.
2. You must lay down **exactly** the contract for that hand — no more, no less.
   • For "2 sets": exactly 2 sets (minimum 6 cards total)
   • For "1 set + 1 run": exactly 1 set and 1 run (minimum 7 cards)
   • You cannot include extra cards, even if they would extend a meld.
3. Lay those cards face up in front of you, clearly separated into sets and runs.
4. On this turn, you only lay down the contract. No laying off extras yet.
5. Discard one card to end your turn.

**Important:** Even if you have cards that could extend one of your melds, you must wait until your next turn to lay them off. On the turn you lay down, you lay down only the exact contract.

After laying down:
• You are considered "down" for this hand.
• On later turns, you can lay off extras and try to empty your hand.

⸻

9. Laying off (adding to melds) — Hands 1–5 only

Starting from your next turn after laying down:

On your turn, after drawing, you may:
• Add cards to any valid melds on the table:
  • Extend runs (e.g. add 5♠ or 10♠ to a 6♠ 7♠ 8♠ 9♠ run)
  • Extend sets (e.g. add another 8 of a different suit to a set of 8s)
  • Use wilds, as long as the meld remains valid and wilds do not outnumber natural cards

Then discard one card.

**Note:** Laying off does not exist in Hand 6. See the Hand 6 section below.

⸻

10. Going out

A hand ends when someone goes out.

**Hands 1 to 5**

To go out:
• On your turn you draw
• Play cards (lay off, use wilds, etc.) until you have one card left
• Discard your last card
• Everyone else then scores the remaining cards in their hand

**Hand 6 — The Final Hand (completely different rules)**

Hand 6 works fundamentally differently from Hands 1–5:

**The core rule: You cannot lay down unless you use EVERY card in your hand.**

This means:
• You start with 11 cards. After drawing, you have 12 cards.
• To lay down, ALL 12 cards must form valid melds (1 set + 2 runs).
• The minimum contract is 3 + 4 + 4 = 11 cards, so you must extend at least one meld by one card.
• When you lay down, you immediately win. There is no discard after laying down.
• Laying down = going out. They are the same action in Hand 6.

**What this means for gameplay:**

1. **No one is ever "down" until someone wins.**
   • The table stays empty of melds the entire hand.
   • Everyone can draw from either stock or discard pile.
   • Everyone can call May I? and veto.

2. **No laying off exists in Hand 6.**
   • There are no melds on the table to lay off to.
   • You cannot be "down" and then add cards on future turns.

3. **No Joker swapping in Hand 6.**
   • There are no runs on the table to swap Jokers from.

4. **May I? is extra risky.**
   • Each May I? gives you 2 extra cards (discard + penalty).
   • If you May I? once, you now have 14 cards that must ALL be used.
   • If you May I? twice, you have 16 cards, etc.
   • All these cards must fit into your 1 set + 2 runs.

5. **Typical turn in Hand 6:**
   • Draw a card (from stock or discard)
   • Check: Can ALL 12+ cards form 1 set + 2 runs?
   • If YES: Lay down everything and win!
   • If NO: Discard one card, next player's turn.

6. **Strategic considerations:**
   • Sometimes winning Hand 6 is unlikely. Players may shift strategy to minimize points.
   • Discarding high-value cards (even wilds!) reduces your score if someone else goes out.
   • But beware: discarding a wild might let another player pick it up and win!

**Example of going out in Hand 6:**
• You have 12 cards after drawing.
• You form: 7♠ 7♦ 7♣ 7♥ (4-card set) + 4♥ 5♥ 6♥ 7♥ (4-card run) + 9♦ 10♦ J♦ Q♦ (4-card run)
• All 12 cards are used. You lay them all down and win!

⸻

11. Stock pile depletion

**The stock pile should never be empty.** When the last card is drawn from the stock:

1. Immediately take the discard pile (except the top exposed card).
2. Shuffle those cards.
3. Place them face down as the new stock pile.
4. The exposed discard remains on the discard pile.

This happens automatically — no player action is required. The game continues seamlessly.

**Extremely rare edge case:** If somehow there are no cards to replenish (all cards are in players' hands), the hand ends immediately and all players score what they hold.

⸻

12. Scoring and winning

After each hand:
1. The player who went out scores 0 points.
2. All other players add up the point values of the cards left in their hand:
   • 3 to 10: face value
   • 2 (wild): 20 points
   • J, Q, K: 10 points
   • Ace: 15 points
   • Joker: 50 points

Write down running totals.

After all 6 hands, the player with the lowest total score is the winner.
